const result = {%= varname %}([

  [baz, { a: 'b' }],
  qux
], {
  prefix: 'tool-plugin-'
})
```

## Background

### What and Why?
Because we need. Because many famous tools do exact same thing. They use same kind
of resolution of their presets, plugins, transforms and whatever you wanna call it.
This one is pretty configurable and small. Most of this resolution can be seen in the
users `package.json`s configs.

For example `browserify.transform` field in package.json

```json
{
  "browserify": {
    "transform": [
      "babel",
      ["uglifyify", {
        "compress": true
      }]
    ]
  }
}
```

And because both [babel][] and [browserify][] uses same resolution things may gone more wild.

Let's take this example

```json
{
  "browserify": {
    "transform": [
      ["babel", {
        "presets": [
          ["es2015", {
            "modules": false
          }]
        ],
        "plugins": [
          ["react", { "some": "more options" }]
          "add-module-exports"
        ]
      }],
      ["uglifyify", {
        "compress": true
      }]
    ]
  }
}
```

And so on, and so on... infinite nesting. That's just freaking crazy, right?

That's all about what this package does - you give it an array and it does such thing - in case with Browserify if they use this package they should pass `browserify.transform` as first argument.

It's so customizable that it match to all their needs - both for Babel plugins/presets/transforms and Browserify transforms. The [browserify][] transforms are a bit different by all others. They accept `filename, options` signature. And so, because they don't accept `options` as first argument, like Babel's transforms or like Rollup's plugins, we need a bit configuration to make things work for Browserify.

That's why this package has `opts` object through which you can pass `opts.first` to set first argument for the plugin/transform function. Another thing that you can do is to pass `opts.args` if you want more control over the passed arguments to the plugin/transform function.


### Resolution

How we resolve plugins? Resolving algorithm has 4 steps. You should know that in the following paragraphs `item` means each element in the passed array to `resolvePluginsSync()`.

**1)** If item is `string`, it tries to require it from
locally installed dependencies, calls it and you can pass
a `opts.prefix` which will be prepended to the item string.
Think for it like `rollup-plugin-`, `babel-plugin-`, `gulp-`
and etc. You may want to see the comments for `resolveFromString` inside the source code.

**2)** If item is `function`, it will call it and if you
want to pass arguments to it you can pass `opts.args` array
or `opts.first`. If `opts.args` is passed it calls that
item function with `.apply`. If `opts.first` is passed
it will pass it as first argument to that function.

**3)** If item is `object`, nothing happens, it just returns it
in the `result` array.

**4)** If item is `array`, then there are few possible
scenarios (see comments for `resolveFromArray` inside the source code):
  - if 1st argument is string - see 1
  - if 1st argument is function - see 2
  - if 2nd argument is object it will be passed to
  that resolve function from 1st argument

## Contributing
Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue](https://github.com/{%= repository %}/issues/new).  
Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for advice on opening issues, pull requests, and coding standards.  
If you need some help and can spent some cash, feel free to [contact me at CodeMentor.io](https://www.codementor.io/tunnckocore?utm_source=github&utm_medium=button&utm_term=tunnckocore&utm_campaign=github) too.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Building docs
Documentation and that readme is generated using [verb-generate-readme][], which is a [verb][] generator, so you need to install both of them and then run `verb` command like that

```
$ npm install verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme --global && verb
```

_Please don't edit the README directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in [.verb.md](.verb.md)._

## Running tests
Clone repository and run the following in that cloned directory

```
$ npm install && npm test
```
